<!-- Gold Per Day takes the total profit and divides it by the number of days the crop spent growing / had to be watered.
Gold Per Season takes the total profit and divides it by the number of days in the season(s) the crop can grow.

If you care more about energy, i.e. how much gold you get from watering each crop, gold per day is a better metric.
If you care more about time, i.e. how much gold you can fit into the season, gold per season is a better metric.

Using Sweet Gem Berry as an example, when ranking by gold per day,
Deluxe Speed-Gro will be ranked higher as it reduces the time needed for the crop to grow.
When ranking by gold per season, Quality Fertilizer will instead be ranked higher,
since it provides one harvest just like Deluxe Speed-Gro but also gives higher profit.

Use total profit if you want to see the sum of profit for the crop across all seasons.
This heavily favors crops that can grow in multiple seasons.


Special Charm and Luck Buff
these settings are here for completion only --
they have a negligable effect on profit.
